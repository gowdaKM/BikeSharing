## General Information
Problem Statement
Build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. 

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits
Business Goal:

Model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer
